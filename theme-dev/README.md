 <summary>Creating a simple theme</summary>
 
  * Start by making a new theme inside of the themer plugin settings, give it a name and it will set version and author automatically for you.
 * You will see multiple categories, choose the Simple Colors category and click on the + icon to add a new string. Add a `background` string and give it some color by clicking on it. 
 * Save, then select restart to see how it looks!
