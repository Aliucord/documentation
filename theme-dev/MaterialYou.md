<h1 align="center">Material You</h1>
The Themer Plugin has custom Material You strings that allow you to make UI Elements match your devices Material You colors by pulling colors from Google's Material You API. This requires directly modifying the JSON file, we reccomend coming into this with at least a little bit of experience to avoid screwing something up

### Getting Started
To get started you need a device with an Android 12 ROM that includes support for Material You. I recommend installing [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ch3d.material.color&hl=en_US&gl=US), this will help you later on. Open the Themer Plugin menu and create a theme, this creates the JSON file that you will use for adding Material You values.
