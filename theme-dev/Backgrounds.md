These are the strings for adding a background and also giving it transparency(alpha). They are in the "background" section in the .json
```json
{
  "url": "url for the bg image, recommended and trusted to use cdn.discordapp.com links",
  "overlay_alpha": "background transparency, goes from 0 to 255, 0 being fully transparent while 255 being fully opaque",
  "blur_radius": "background blur, goes from 0 to 25, 0 being no blur and 25 a lot of blur. yep I cant tell you better"
}
```
When done correctly it should look like this in the json
