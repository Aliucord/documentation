Q: **What is the difference between Simple themes and Advanced Themes?**

A: Well, A simple theme uses strings which groups multiple strings together making it easier to theme with, you could basically create a theme in less than a minute.
An Advanced theme on the other hand gives you more control with a lot of different strings but is difficult to understand on your own, however if you know what you're doing you can create a beautiful theme.

| ```mention_highlight``` | background color when you're mentioned. |
| ```active_channel``` | does not change anything as far as I can see. |
| ```status_bar``` | changes the color of the status bar, ```background_secondary``` takes priority over this. |
| ```input_background``` | color of user notes background, magnify icon, channel name and topic, and role name when creating a new role. | 
> Note: If the color of the string has changed but you dont see a difference, ask for help in the support channel in the Discord Server.
