<h1 align="center">Simple Strings</h1>

These are the simple strings, use them if you dont want to change multiple strings with the same color. Simple Strings basically group up multiple strings into one simple string


| String | Purpose |
| --------- | :----------------------- |
| background | changes the main backgrounds |
| background_secondary | changes secondary backgrounds |
| mention_highlight | changes the mention highlight on a message you got pinged in |
| active_channel | changes nothing as far as I see |
| statusbar | changes the statusbar where your battary precentege is, time clock, etc |
| input_background | changes the background of places where you can enter text, for example: Notes in a user profile, Role name enter |


* Normal strings take priority over Simple Strings so if a string in the simple string group is changed by adding it in color, that string will get prioritized
* If you want to know what strings get changed using the simple strings check ![this](https://github.com/Vendicated/AliucordPlugins/blob/1d7ba8900ad6d4cfb17e6be670e273a8b9cee212/Themer/src/main/kotlin/dev/vendicated/aliucordplugs/themer/Constants.kt#L71#135) out
