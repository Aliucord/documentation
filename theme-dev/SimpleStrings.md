* If the color of the string has changed but you dont see a difference, ask for help in the support channel in the Discord Server.
* Normal strings take priority over Simple Strings so if a string in the simple string group is changed by adding it in color, that string will get prioritized
* If you want to know what strings get changed using the simple strings check [this](https://github.com/Vendicated/AliucordPlugins/blob/1d7ba8900ad6d4cfb17e6be670e273a8b9cee212/Themer/src/main/kotlin/dev/vendicated/aliucordplugs/themer/Constants.kt#L71#135) out
