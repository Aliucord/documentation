| brand_new up to 900 | new brand colors |
| brand_new | accent color |
| brand_new_360 | changes the cursor when typing color, bare in mind this WILL change the nitro text color in the settings, the turned on switch(best seen in plugins page) and probably more 
| brand_new 230 to 630 | accent colors for buttons, bot tags, on/off sliders blah blah |
| brand_new_560 | change the reaction clicked border |
