# Font Strings

The string for the font URL. The string is located in the "fonts" section in the .json which you can find in your ```/Aliucord/Themes``` folder.
```json
{
  "*": "url of the font, recommended and trusted to use cdn.discordapp.com links",
  "ginto_bold": "changes categories, channel names, and headers in user settings",
  "ginto_medium": "changes user settings category names, and the channel name in the member list",
  "ginto_regular": "changes nothing for me, you can test it if you want",
  "roboto_medium_numbers": "changes nothing for me, you can test it if you want",
  "sourcecodepro_semibold": "changes nothing for me, you can test it if you want",
  "whitney_bold": "changes server template names, and Invite should look like this",
  "whitney_medium": "changes message text, channel names, button names, etc",
  "whitney_semibold": "changes selected channel name, DM List names, etc"
}
```
When done correctly it should look like this in the json
