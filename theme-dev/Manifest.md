<h1 align="center">Manifest</h1>

**DO NOT CHANGE THE JSON FILE UNLESS NECESSARY, OR ELSE YOU WILL MESS UP YOUR THEME BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.**

> Strings used for the plugin to tell the user what the name of the theme is, author, version, License, etc but also things like custom font and custom background


* The manifest strings

Used to show name of the theme, author, etc. They are in the "manifest" section in the .json
```json
{
  "name": "the theme name",
  "author": "authors name",
  "license": "license, ask if you want to add one but dont know how to or what license to choose in #theme-development",
  "version": "this is the verion number, do not use text for updater",
  "updater": "this is where you put your raw.githubusercontent.com link, if you ever want to update your theme just bump the version number up"
}
```
When done correctly it should look like this in the json
